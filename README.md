Welcom to OMS system !!!

This is my pet project.

This is a software that helps you manage the goods in the warehouse at a basic level, plus there are features to help users look up products, order, and so on. Store customer information for shipping. It can track order quantity, calculate order,...

This is open source and free .You can edit that if you know you are doing. 

You can login to administration section with : username: admin, password: password
If you want refresh data after each month you should create file .bat . IT can help you auto clean all data saved in order.txt, infocustom.txt,orderfood.txt.
but data products save in search isn't removed.

-file infocustom.txt will save information of customers
-file search.dat save informations of products
-file order.txt save informations of order
-file orderfood.txt save informations of name's products and quantity sold 
-file food.exe is run file
-file foodorder.c is source code
