Welcom to OMS system !!!

This is my pet project.
Warning : This is instruction to use that project , not a file system.This is open source and free .You can edit that if you know you are doing. 

You can login to administration section with : username: admin, password: password
If you want refresh data after each month you should create file .bat . IT can help you auto clean all data saved in order.txt, infocustom.txt,orderfood.txt.
but data products save in search isn't removed.

-file infocustom.txt will save information of customers
-file search.dat save informations of products
-file order.txt save informations of order
-file orderfood.txt save informations of name's products and quantity sold 
-file food.exe is run file
-file foodorder.c is source code
